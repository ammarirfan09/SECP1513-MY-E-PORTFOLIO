							<h2>Reflection for all assignment and test</h2>
							<p> After 5 months of learning this course, all the assignments and tests have given me a lot of knowledge and changed how I think about this course. This is my reflection on all of it.</p>
							<div class="features">
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-code"></span>
									<h3> Assignment 1</h3>
									<p>The career talk helped me understand the importance of information and communication technology (ICT) in many industries today.
										The speakers shared their work experiences and showed how ICT is used beyond computers, such as in creating coatings and paints to strengthen products.
										The session motivated me to explore ICT further, as it is a growing field with many future opportunities.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-lock"></span>
									<h3>Assigment 2(video)</h3>
									<p>Based on the making of the video, teamwork taught me the importance of cooperation, communication, and respect among team members.
										By working together, we can share ideas, solve problems more effectively, and achieve better results than working alone.
										This experience helped me understand that teamwork is essential for success in both academic and professional environments.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-cog"></span>
									<h3>assignment 3</h3>
									<p>Based on the talk given by TS. HJ. Abdul Alim bin Abdul Mutallib, I learned about the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC), a concept widely used by programmers and other professionals.
										I also learned that SDLC is not only applied in software development, but can be used in daily activities, such as planning before carrying out a task.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-desktop"></span>
									<h3>Assignment 4</h3>
									<p>The industrial visit to JohorPort was a valuable experience that showed us how modern technology and automation improve efficiency and safety in port operations.
										It also helped us understand the important role of the ICT department in managing systems and supporting industrial activities.
										Overall, the visit increased our appreciation of how IT contributes to efficiency and sustainable industrial development.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-link"></span>
									<h3>Pc assemble</h3>
									<p>The PC assembly activity helped me understand computer hardware components and how they work together.
										By assembling the PC, I gained hands-on experience and improved my technical and problem-solving skills.
										This activity increased my confidence in handling computer hardware in the future.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-gem"></span>
									<h3>Project Design Thinking</h3>
									<p>At the end of the semester, I hope to apply the skills and knowledge I gained from this course in the future and share my understanding of technology with others.
										The design thinking project helped me realize the importance of teamwork in achieving a common goal.
										It also improved my ability to brainstorm ideas and collaborate effectively with my team.</p>
